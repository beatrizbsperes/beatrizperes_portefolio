                    <h3>Quantifying vulnerability to natural hazards in changing climate patterns</h3>
                    <h3>New perspectives and methods</h3>
                    <p>In April 2025, I participated in a Blended Intensive Programme (BIP) hosted
                        by the University of Bucharest, focusing on "Quantifying Vulnerability to Natural
                        Hazards in Changing Climate Patterns: New Perspectives and Methods". This program
                        combined virtual sessions with a field component in Romania, offering a comprehensive
                        understanding of vulnerability assessment.</p>

                <div class="experience-item">
                    <h3>Virtual component</h3>
                    <p>Over five weeks, during the month of March, we engaged in weekly sessions covering topics such
                        as:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>Vulnerability in the Age of the Anthropocene</ul>
                    <ul>Dynamics of Geohazards and Disasters in Fragile Landscapes</ul>
                    <ul>Sea Level Changes and Adaptation Methods</ul>
                    <ul>Increasing Resilience of Landscapes and Communities to Climate Change Impacts</ul>
                    <ul>Social Vulnerability in Coastal Environments</ul>
                    <ul>Climatic and Tectonic Signals in Landscape Evolution</ul>
                    <ul>Changing Geohazards in Response to Tectonic and Climatic Forcing</ul>
                    <ul>State of the Climate</ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>These sessions featured experts from various disciplines, including climate change,
                        geomorphology, engineering, psychology, sociology and anthropology, providing a holistic view
                        of vulnerabilities.</p>

                    <h3>Field Experience in the Vrancea Seismic Region</h3>
                    <p>So we could finally put on practice what we have been learning,
                        from the 7th to the 11th of April, the was accompanied by
                        five lecturers. The field component took place in Bucharest and Vrancea region.</p>
                    <ul>Day 1 – Bucharest Kickoff</ul>
                    <p>Our journey began in Bucharest, where we were introduced to the region's geological
                        setting through lectures focused on geomorphological processes. Later, we explored the
                        city on foot, observing how structural retrofitting has been applied to buildings still
                        vulnerable
                        to seismic activity—a legacy of the devastating 1977 earthquake. On this same day we drove to
                        Vrancea region</p>
                    <ul>Day 2 – Into the Vrancea Seismic Zone</ul>
                    <p>We headed to Pătârlagele, located in the heart of the Vrancea seismic region. The day’s field
                        stops included a shallow landslide developed in the molasse formations of the Subcarpathians,
                        followed by a visit to a reservoir site where human-induced slope instability had become evident
                        due to construction activities.</p>
                    <ul>Day 3 – Multi-Hazard Landscapes</ul>
                    <p>Our morning began with a visit to a site affected by a landslide triggered by seismic
                        activity—an example of how one hazard can lead to another. In the afternoon, we hiked
                        through an area recently shaped by mudflows, discussing strategies for predicting and
                        managing such climate-related events.</p>
                    <ul>Day 4 – Risk at the Local Scale</ul>
                    <p>We explored a nearby village on foot, comparing different styles of residential
                        buildings, which highlighted clear contrasts in structural vulnerability. Later, we
                        visited active mud volcanoes and reflected on the complications that arise when attempting
                        disaster
                        risk reduction in protected or environmentally sensitive areas.</p>
                    <ul>Day 5 – Presenting Our Insights</ul>
                    <p>On our final day, we worked in small teams to present our impact chain models, integrating
                        what we had observed throughout the week. We wrapped up the fieldwork with a visit to the
                        Natural
                        Hazards Research Center in Pătârlagele, where researchers shared insights into their ongoing
                        projects.
                        That evening, we returned to Bucharest.</p>
