                    <h3>Course Description</h3>
                    <p>This course presents key elements of general system theory and complexity theory. These conceptual
                         foundations shall introduce what it means to "think with the systems lens", and why systems offer a 
                         generative and holistic as opposed to an analytical and reductionistic approach to understanding 
                         geographical phenomena.</p>
                    <p>Students shall be able to make use of systems thinking in order to approach the complexity of 
                        (geographical) reality. We will discuss strategies and approaches to address complex problems,
                         where a specific focus will be given on how spatial relations structure a system. Several application 
                         fields ranging from the physical world, to ecosystems and social spaces shall serve as examples.</p>                        
                    <p>Motivation: to digitally represent a model of our complex world with its nested hierarchies and 
                        spatial relationships emerging in patterns at various scales ideally takes a systems-driven viewpoint.</p>

                    <h3>A Spatial Simulation Approach to Model Grazing Dynamics on Vierkaser Pasture, Austria</h3>
                    <p>This study employs spatial simulation to model the grazing dynamics on Vierkaser pasture, located on 
                        Untersberg, Austria, with the goal of determining the maximum sustainable number of cows that can graze 
                        without disrupting the ecosystem. Using geospatial data and ecosystem modeling, the study integrates Agent-Based
                         Modeling (ABM) for simulating cow movement and grazing behavior and Cellular Automata (CA) for grass regrowth dynamics.
                          The 5-meter resolution grid-based model is initialized with realistic environmental parameters, dividing the pasture
                           into distinct areas with varying biomass productivity: lower pasture, Hirschanger, meadow and cutback areas.</p>
                    <p>The model begins with cows randomly distributed across grassland areas. Cows prioritize 
                        grazing spots with higher biomass and reduce grass biomass incrementally with each grazing action. 
                        Grass regrowth is parameterized to align with field observations, achieving a balance between grazing 
                        intensity and regrowth rates over time. The simulation identifies an equilibrium point at which grass 
                        regrowth sustains cow grazing without degrading the pasture ecosystem. Results indicate a carrying capacity of
                         approximately 20 cows for Vierkaser pasture. Beyond this threshold, overgrazing leads to biomass depletion, 
                         diminishing ecosystem resilience and causing cow mortality.</p>
                    <p>Key findings highlight that zones with higher biomass stability, such as the Cleaned 2020 and Cleaned 2021–2023
                         areas, are better suited for sustainable grazing, while zones like Hirschanger exhibit lower resilience due
                          to limited regrowth potential. These spatial variations emphasize the need for tailored grazing strategies
                           to maintain ecosystem balance. The study underscores the ecological viability of traditional grazing 
                           practices when informed by spatial simulation, providing a quantitative framework for sustainable pasture 
                           management.</p>
                    <p>Future research can extend the model by incorporating additional variables such as wildlife interactions, 
                        climate variability, and soil dynamics, offering a more comprehensive approach to alpine grazing systems.
                         This research demonstrates the utility of spatial simulation as a decision-support tool for environmental
                          management, enabling informed decisions to preserve the delicate balance of mountain ecosystems.</p>
