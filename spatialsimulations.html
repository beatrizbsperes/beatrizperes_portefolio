                    <h3>Course Description</h3>
                    <p>This course presents key elements of general system theory and complexity theory. These
                        conceptual
                        foundations shall introduce what it means to "think with the systems lens", and why systems
                        offer a
                        generative and holistic as opposed to an analytical and reductionistic approach to understanding
                        geographical phenomena.</p>
                    <p>Students shall be able to make use of systems thinking in order to approach the complexity of
                        (geographical) reality. We will discuss strategies and approaches to address complex problems,
                        where a specific focus will be given on how spatial relations structure a system. Several
                        application
                        fields ranging from the physical world, to ecosystems and social spaces shall serve as examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>Motivation: to digitally represent a model of our complex world with its nested hierarchies and
                        spatial relationships emerging in patterns at various scales ideally takes a systems-driven
                        viewpoint.</p>

                    <h3>A Spatial Simulation Approach to Model Grazing Dynamics on Vierkaser Pasture, Austria</h3>
                    <p>This study employs spatial simulation to model the grazing dynamics on Vierkaser pasture, located
                        on
                        Untersberg, Austria, with the goal of determining the maximum sustainable number of cows that
                        can graze
                        without disrupting the ecosystem. Using geospatial data and ecosystem modeling, the study
                        integrates Agent-Based
                        Modeling (ABM) for simulating cow movement and grazing behavior and Cellular Automata (CA) for
                        grass regrowth dynamics.
                        The 5-meter resolution grid-based model is initialized with realistic environmental parameters,
                        dividing the pasture
                        into distinct areas with varying biomass productivity: lower pasture, Hirschanger, meadow and
                        cutback areas.</p>
                    <p>The model begins with cows randomly distributed across grassland areas. Cows prioritize
                        grazing spots with higher biomass and reduce grass biomass incrementally with each grazing
                        action.
                        Grass regrowth is parameterized to align with field observations, achieving a balance between
                        grazing
                        intensity and regrowth rates over time. The simulation identifies an equilibrium point at which
                        grass
                        regrowth sustains cow grazing without degrading the pasture ecosystem. Results indicate a
                        carrying capacity of
                        approximately 20 cows for Vierkaser pasture. Beyond this threshold, overgrazing leads to biomass
                        depletion,
                        diminishing ecosystem resilience and causing cow mortality.</p>
                    <p>Key findings highlight that zones with higher biomass stability, such as the Cleaned 2020 and
                        Cleaned 2021â€“2023
                        areas, are better suited for sustainable grazing, while zones like Hirschanger exhibit lower
                        resilience due
                        to limited regrowth potential. These spatial variations emphasize the need for tailored grazing
                        strategies
                        to maintain ecosystem balance. The study underscores the ecological viability of traditional
                        grazing
                        practices when informed by spatial simulation, providing a quantitative framework for
                        sustainable pasture
                        management.</p>
                    <p>Future research can extend the model by incorporating additional variables such as wildlife
                        interactions,
                        climate variability, and soil dynamics, offering a more comprehensive approach to alpine grazing
                        systems.
                        This research demonstrates the utility of spatial simulation as a decision-support tool for
                        environmental
                        management, enabling informed decisions to preserve the delicate balance of mountain ecosystems.
